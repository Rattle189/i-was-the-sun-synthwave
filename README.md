# For all you Novakid and synthwave lovers.
This simple mod adds a new track entirely and patches the Starbound main menu theme to be Patchwork Demon's I Was The Sun (Before It Was Cool) 80's Synthwave cover instead.

This mod also supports [Betabound!](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2010607826) or the standalone [Music Radios!](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2787383493) and can be acquired as a loot drop to be playable on a Portable or Stationary Radio if installed.

**I, Rattle189, do not own any of the content included in this mod. The album art (also used as the mod's thumbnail) and music track is all done by Patchwork Demon.**
